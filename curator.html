  <h1>Curatorial Work</h1>
  <p>
    My curatorial practice operates across worldsâ€”digital, embodied, civic, celestial. I build containers for collective transformation. Whether itâ€™s a street-level warehouse or a virtual landscape, I shape spaces for experimental art, speculative technology, and emergent community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below are some of the exhibitions and platforms Iâ€™ve had the honor of curating or founding, alongside the brilliant artists who helped define them.

  <h2>Underground Atlanta (2020â€“2022)</h2>
  <p>As <strong>Creative Director of Underground Atlanta</strong>, I led the transformation of one of Atlantaâ€™s most storied spaces from a forgotten relic into a vibrant nexus of art, culture, and possibility. When I arrived, Underground was physically decaying and culturally dormant. Within the first six months, our initiatives brought over <strong>100,000 visitors</strong> to the siteâ€”rekindling its spirit and restoring it to public imagination.</p>

  <p>I launched the <a href="https://saportareport.com/another-era-of-underground-atlanta-the-city-beneath-the-city/columnists/hannah-jones/hannah/" target="_blank"><strong>Underground Roots Program</strong></a>, offering rent-free studios and storefronts to over 70 artists, curators, musicians, and creative entrepreneurs. This initiative empowered a new generation of experimental makers while activating the cityâ€™s architecture as a platform for performance, installation, and civic dreaming.</p>

  <p>My work helped attract over <strong>$40 million in investment</strong> and established international partnerships that connected Atlantaâ€™s underground to a global network of curators, technologists, and institutions. I curated installations, developed residency infrastructure, and turned forgotten tunnels into laboratories of light and sound.</p>

  <p>Flagship spaces like <em>No Tomorrow</em>, <em>Innerspace Gallery</em>, and <em>Emmcdee</em> emerged as grassroots venues for performance art, live music, AI-powered exhibits, and digital art showcases. In 2022, I co-produced and hosted the inaugural <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2022/02/25/inaugural-atlanta-digital-art-week-opens-at-underground/" target="_blank"><strong>Atlanta Digital Art Week</strong></a>â€”a citywide festival of immersive technology, NFTs, XR, and generative mediaâ€”bringing over 75 international artists to Underground Atlanta.</p>

  <p>Through this curatorial and strategic work, I didnâ€™t just reimagine Undergroundâ€”I redefined its purpose. The project became a living proof-of-concept for how art and culture can drive economic revitalization, spatial justice, and collective re-enchantment.</p>
