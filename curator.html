  <h1>Curatorial Work</h1>
  <p>
    My curatorial practice operates across worlds—digital, embodied, civic, celestial. I build containers for collective transformation. Whether it’s a street-level warehouse or a virtual landscape, I shape spaces for experimental art, speculative technology, and emergent community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below are some of the exhibitions and platforms I’ve had the honor of curating or founding, alongside the brilliant artists who helped define them.

  <h2>Underground Atlanta (2020–2022)</h2>
  <p>As <strong>Creative Director of Underground Atlanta</strong>, I led the transformation of one of Atlanta’s most storied spaces from a forgotten relic into a vibrant nexus of art, culture, and possibility. When I arrived, Underground was physically decaying and culturally dormant. Within the first six months, our initiatives brought over <strong>100,000 visitors</strong> to the site—rekindling its spirit and restoring it to public imagination.</p>

  <p>I launched the <a href="https://saportareport.com/another-era-of-underground-atlanta-the-city-beneath-the-city/columnists/hannah-jones/hannah/" target="_blank"><strong>Underground Roots Program</strong></a>, offering rent-free studios and storefronts to over 70 artists, curators, musicians, and creative entrepreneurs. This initiative empowered a new generation of experimental makers while activating the city’s architecture as a platform for performance, installation, and civic dreaming.</p>

  <p>My work helped attract over <strong>$40 million in investment</strong> and established international partnerships that connected Atlanta’s underground to a global network of curators, technologists, and institutions. I curated installations, developed residency infrastructure, and turned forgotten tunnels into laboratories of light and sound.</p>

  <p>Flagship spaces like <em>No Tomorrow</em>, <em>Innerspace Gallery</em>, and <em>Emmcdee</em> emerged as grassroots venues for performance art, live music, AI-powered exhibits, and digital art showcases. In 2022, I co-produced and hosted the inaugural <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2022/02/25/inaugural-atlanta-digital-art-week-opens-at-underground/" target="_blank"><strong>Atlanta Digital Art Week</strong></a>—a citywide festival of immersive technology, NFTs, XR, and generative media—bringing over 75 international artists to Underground Atlanta.</p>

  <p>Through this curatorial and strategic work, I didn’t just reimagine Underground—I redefined its purpose. The project became a living proof-of-concept for how art and culture can drive economic revitalization, spatial justice, and collective re-enchantment.</p>

  <h2>NUBIA: Metaverses, NFTs, and New Realities</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>“NUBIA: Metaverses, NFTs, and New Realities”</strong> brings together a selection of immersive experiences and digital environments created by Catalan artists and collectives, as well as international guests invited to join the NUBIA collective. Through the program, participating artists receive mentorship, training, and support during the early stages of their projects.
    <br><br>
    Each metaverse proposed by the artists follows its own logic—inviting collectors, visitors, and experts to explore, engage, and socialize through gamification, immersion, and interaction. These virtual worlds are inhabited by fantastical avatars and digital artworks curated by <strong>Alejandro Martín</strong> and <strong>Kris Pilcher</strong>
