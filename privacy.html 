   This is a general privacy policy for all of my immersive experiences, apps, games, or computer programs. 
   
   I DON'T SAVE YOUR DATA. Sometimes, in order to give you the best immersive experience possible, I need to access certain sensors, files, or other aspects of your device. 
   <p> This is only done during runtime, and I would never violate your trust by: 
   <p> <p> <p> Selling your data
   <p> <p> Serving you advertisements (unless this is a sponsored app or program and then only under the terms of the project)
   <p> Spying on you
      
   <p> Have fun with the experience and please feel free to contact me with any concerns. 
   
   love,
